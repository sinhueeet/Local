git remote add [-t <branch>] [-m <master>] [-f] [--[no-]tags] [--mirror=<fetch|push>] <name> <url>

add

    Adds a remote named <name> for the repository at <url>. The command git fetch <name> can then be used to create and update remote-tracking branches <name>/<branch>.

    With -f option, git fetch <name> is run immediately after the remote information is set up.

    With --tags option, git fetch <name> imports every tag from the remote repository.

    With --no-tags option, git fetch <name> does not import tags from the remote repository.

    By default, only tags on fetched branches are imported (see git-fetch(1)).

    With -t <branch> option, instead of the default glob refspec for the remote to track all branches under the refs/remotes/<name>/ namespace, a refspec to track only <branch> is created. You can give more than one -t <branch> to track multiple branches without grabbing all branches.

    With -m <master> option, a symbolic-ref refs/remotes/<name>/HEAD is set up to point at remote’s <master> branch. See also the set-head command.

    When a fetch mirror is created with --mirror=fetch, the refs will not be stored in the refs/remotes/ namespace, but rather everything in refs/ on the remote will be directly mirrored into refs/ in the local repository. This option only makes sense in bare repositories, because a fetch would overwrite any local commits.

    When a push mirror is created with --mirror=push, then git push will always behave as if --mirror was passed.
